        <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>I grew up in Los Angeles and moved to Portland when I was 18 to attend Lewis & Clark College. I studied abroad for a formative year in Munich, Germany at Ludwig Maximillian Universitaet. I bartended and worked in a Gymnasium, which is the name for the highest level of primary education in Germany. Children are basically expected to make a career choice around age twelve in Germany and I found this unbelievable. Upon return to the States, I made the decision to test the waters of the legal field before committing to law school. Five years later, I am now a technology specialist at a boutique firm that specializes in labor and employment.</p>

    <h3>Skills / Interests / Hobbies</h3>
          <p>I almost always have a podcast running during my free time. My general interests include politics, music, design, and technology. I try to spend at least one day each week out on my own exploring. I often pick a direction at random and take a bus or train in that direction until I find something appealing. I buy an excessive amount of vintage clothing because I like knowing that most vintage pieces are one of a kind. I deconstruct and reconstruct the materials into something that incorporates a more modern feel.</p>
